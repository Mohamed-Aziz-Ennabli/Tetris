## About the Project

This project is a modern, simple implementation of the classic arcade game **Tetris**, written in Java. The game features core Tetris mechanics, including random tetromino generation, block rotation, line clearing, and level progression.

The project was created for those interested in learning about game development with Java and understanding basic game loops, graphical rendering, and user input handling in Java.

## Features

- **Random Tetrominoes**: Includes all seven classic tetromino shapes (I, O, T, L, J, S, Z).
- **Keyboard Controls**: Move, rotate, and drop blocks using the keyboard.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points by clearing lines.
- **Leveling System**: The game increases in difficulty as you clear more lines.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when the tetrominoes stack beyond the top of the game board.
